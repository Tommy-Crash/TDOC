## 3. THE THREE PROFIT KILLERS — 

### A. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT — The Livongo Hangover

| Year  | Goodwill Impairment | Remaining Goodwill |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2022  | ~$9,600M           | ~$1,073M           |
| 2023  | $0                 | $1,073M            |
| 2024  | $790M (BetterHelp) | **$283M**          |
| 2025  | $71.8M (Catapult/Telecare) | **$283M**   |

**VERDICT: Nearly fully written down. Only $283M of goodwill remains.**
The 2020 Livongo acquisition ($18.5B) destroyed ~$15B+ in shareholder value through impairments.
This is almost done. Minimal future impairment risk from remaining $283M balance.

### B. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES — The Silent Killer

| Period | Amort. Expense | Intangible Assets (Net) | Per Share Impact |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| FY2023 | $325.9M       | $1,677.8M              | -$1.48/share    |
| FY2024 | $363.4M       | $1,431.4M              | -$1.35/share    |
| 9M2025 | $258.7M       | $1,336.7M              | -$1.47/share    |
| FY2025E| ~$345M        | ~$1,250M (est.)        | ~-$1.95/share   |

**VERDICT: THIS IS THE #1 REASON TDOC ISN'T GAAP PROFITABLE.**
- Running at ~$345M/year (~$86M/quarter)
- Represents customer relationships, technology, and trade names from acquisitions
- Net balance: $1,337M → at current rate, ~3.5-4 years until substantially reduced
- PURELY NON-CASH — no impact on cash flow whatsoever
- Will naturally decline each year as assets fully amortize

### C. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION — Improving Rapidly

| Period | SBC Expense | Per Share Impact | Trend    |
|--------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| FY2023 | $201.6M    | -$1.22/share    |          |
| FY2024 | $146.0M    | -$0.86/share    | ↓ 28%    |
| 9M2025 | $64.5M     | -$0.37/share    |          |
| FY2025E| ~$86M      | ~-$0.49/share   | ↓ 41%    |

**VERDICT: Already fixing itself.** Down from $201M → estimated $86M in just 2 years.
Reflects lower stock price = fewer option grants needed, plus post-restructuring smaller headcount.

## 4. BRIDGE TO POSITIVE EPS — What Needs to Change?

### Current State (FY2025 Guidance Midpoint)
```
Expected Net Loss:                     -$207M    (-$1.18/share)
Shares Outstanding:                     ~176M

NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN THAT LOSS:
  + Amortization of Intangibles         +$345M    (+$1.96/share)
  + Stock-Based Compensation             +$86M    (+$0.49/share)
  + Goodwill Impairments                 +$72M    (+$0.41/share)
  + Depreciation                         +$14M    (+$0.08/share)
  + Restructuring                        +$16M    (+$0.09/share)
                                        ──────
  = ADJUSTED EARNINGS                   +$326M    (+$1.85/share) ✅ ALREADY POSITIVE
```

### THE MATH: Just Removing Amortization Makes TDOC Profitable
```
GAAP Net Loss (FY2025E):               -$207M    (-$1.18/share)
+ Amortization of Intangibles:         +$345M    (+$1.96/share)
                                        ──────
= CASH EARNINGS (ex-amort only):       +$138M    (+$0.78/share) ✅ POSITIVE
```

**The single biggest lever is amortization of intangibles ($345M/yr).
Without that ONE item, TDOC would already be GAAP profitable.**

---

## 5. REALISTIC TIMELINE TO GAAP-POSITIVE EPS

### Scenario Analysis: When Does GAAP EPS Turn Positive?

**Current Annual Drags (FY2025):**
- Amortization: ~$345M (declining ~$20-30M/year naturally)
- SBC: ~$86M (declining ~$30M/year)
- Goodwill: ~$72M (should be near zero going forward, only $283M left)
- Restructuring: ~$16M (one-time, should end)

**Assumption: Adjusted EBITDA stays ~$280M (conservative)**

| Year   | Amort (est.) | SBC (est.) | Goodwill | Restructuring | Net Adjustment | Adj. EBITDA | GAAP Operating Profit? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 2025   | $345M       | $86M      | $72M     | $16M          | $519M          | $280M       | No (-$239M)          |
| 2026E  | $310M       | $65M      | $0       | $5M           | $380M          | $290M       | No (-$90M)           |
| 2027E  | $260M       | $55M      | $0       | $0            | $315M          | $300M       | **CLOSE (-$15M)**    |
| 2028E  | $200M       | $50M      | $0       | $0            | $250M          | $310M       | **YES (+$60M)**      |

**Best case: GAAP breakeven by late 2027**
**Base case: GAAP profitable in 2028**
**If BetterHelp recovers faster or intangibles amortize faster: could accelerate to 2026-2027**

---

## 6. WHAT CAN MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY CHANGE?

### Lever 1: FIX BETTERHELP (Highest Impact)
```
BetterHelp Adjusted EBITDA Trend:
  2023: $136.2M (12.0% margin)
  2024:  $77.8M ( 7.5% margin)  ↓↓
  2025E: ~$31M  (~2.7% margin)  ↓↓↓ BLEEDING

BetterHelp Revenue Trend:
  2023: $1,133.6M
  2024: $1,040.7M  (-8.2%)
  2025E:  ~$953M   (-8.5%)
```
- BetterHelp spends enormous amounts on advertising (majority of the $706M/yr ad budget)
- Paying users declining: 457K (2023) → 405K (2024) → 389K (2025)
- Insurance acceptance rollout could stabilize users and reduce CAC
- **IF BetterHelp margins return to 12%: adds ~$85M to bottom line = +$0.48/share**

### Lever 2: CONTINUE SBC REDUCTION (Already Happening)
```
SBC Trajectory:
  2023: $201.6M
  2024: $146.0M  (-28%)
  2025E: ~$86M   (-41%)
  2026E: ~$65M   (target)  → saves another $21M = +$0.12/share
```

### Lever 3: GROW INTEGRATED CARE (Margin Expansion)
```
Integrated Care EBITDA Margin:
  2023: 13.1%
  2024: 15.2%  ↑
  2025: ~15.2% (steady)
  Target: 18-20% → could add $45-75M = +$0.25-$0.43/share
```
- Members growing (94M → 103M) but ARPU declining ($1.41 → $1.27)
- Need to cross-sell more services per member and raise ARPU

### Lever 4: CUT ADVERTISING SPEND (Risky but Powerful)
```
Ad & Marketing Spend:
  2023: $688.9M (26.5% of revenue)
  2024: $705.8M (27.5% of revenue)  ← INCREASED despite lower revenue
  9M2025: $503.7M (26.7%)

If cut to 22% of revenue (~$560M): saves ~$146M = +$0.83/share
```
- Most of this is BetterHelp direct-to-consumer marketing
- Cutting too aggressively accelerates BetterHelp revenue decline
- Insurance acceptance at BetterHelp could naturally reduce needed ad spend over time

### Lever 5: REDUCE G&A OVERHEAD
```
G&A Trend (including SBC portion):
  2023: $464.7M (17.9% of revenue)
  2024: $435.5M (16.9% of revenue)
  9M2025: $323.5M (17.1% annualized)
  
G&A ex-SBC:
  2024: $435.5M - $68.9M SBC = $366.6M
  Target 14% of revenue: ~$357M → saves ~$10M
```

---

## 7. BALANCE SHEET SNAPSHOT (as of Sept 30, 2025)

```
ASSETS                              LIABILITIES
Cash:           $726M               Convertible Notes:  $994M (due 2027)
Accounts Rec:   $211M               Accounts Payable:    $52M
Intangibles:  $1,337M (amortizing)  Accrued Expenses:   $206M
Goodwill:       $283M               Other Liabilities:   $234M
Other:          $322M               ────────────────────────────
────────────                        Total Liabilities: $1,486M
Total Assets: $2,879M               Equity:           $1,392M

Debt-to-Equity: ~0.71x
Net Debt: $994M notes - $726M cash = $268M net debt
```

**Key concern:** $994M convertible notes due 2027. They'll need to refinance or repay.
They already repaid $551M in Q2 2025, reducing cash from $1.3B to $726M.

## 8. SUMMARY — THE BULL CASE FOR POSITIVE EPS

### What's ACTUALLY preventing positive GAAP EPS today:

| Item | Annual Impact | Cash Impact? | Will It Go Away? |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Amortization of Intangibles** | **-$345M (-$1.96/sh)** | **NO** | **Yes, declining ~$30M/yr** |
| Stock-Based Comp | -$86M (-$0.49/sh) | No (dilution) | Declining rapidly |
| Goodwill Impairments | -$72M (-$0.41/sh) | No | Nearly done ($283M left) |
| Restructuring | -$16M (-$0.09/sh) | Yes | Likely ending |
| BetterHelp Margin Erosion | -$100M+ vs 2023 | Yes | Uncertain |

### The most important thing to understand:

1. **TDOC is already cash-flow positive**: $170-185M free cash flow guided for 2025
2. **TDOC is already "adjusted" profitable**: ~$280M adjusted EBITDA in 2025
3. **The GAAP loss is 80%+ driven by non-cash amortization from the Livongo deal**
4. **Amortization is the ONLY item that makes GAAP EPS negative** (even including SBC, ex-amortization TDOC is profitable)
5. **This amortization is DECLINING every year and will largely phase out by 2028-2029**

### What could accelerate the path:
- BetterHelp stabilization + insurance acceptance → margin recovery
- Further SBC reduction (already on track)
- Integrated Care ARPU improvement / cross-selling
- Modest revenue growth (even 2-3% helps)
- No more goodwill impairments (likely, given small remaining balance)

### What could delay it:
- BetterHelp continues declining (biggest risk)
- More acquisitions creating new goodwill/intangible balances
- Convertible debt refinancing at higher rates
- Competitive pressure on Integrated Care ARPU

## 9. TDOC AT A GLANCE

```
CASH:           $726M   (was $1.3B → paid off $551M convertible notes in Q2 2025)
DEBT:           $994M   (convertible notes due 2027, need to refinance)
NET DEBT:       $268M   ($994M - $726M)
FREE CASH FLOW: ~$175M/yr  (the business DOES generate cash)

GOODWILL:       $283M   (100% Integrated Care, BetterHelp = $0)
                        Was $14.5B post-Livongo → $13B+ written off
                        Almost done. Low risk of further impairment.

AMORTIZATION:   ~$345M/yr (~$86M/qtr) — THE reason EPS is negative
                $1,337M intangibles remaining, declining ~$30M/yr
                Purely non-cash. Zero impact on cash flow.

SBC:            ~$86M/yr and falling fast
                $201M (2023) → $146M (2024) → ~$86M (2025) → ~$65M (2026E)

ADJUSTED EBITDA: ~$280M/yr — ALREADY PROFITABLE on operating basis
GAAP EPS:        ~-$1.18/yr — negative ONLY because of amortization
