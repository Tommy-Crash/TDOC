# Teladoc Health (TDOC) - 3-Year Quarterly Earnings Deep Dive
## Why Isn't TDOC Profitable? Where's The Money Going? Path to Positive EPS

---

## Data Notes (Read This First)

- **As-of date**: Financial statement + KPI figures are presented **through Q3 2025 / Sept 30, 2025**, unless otherwise noted.
- **Source of truth**: Teladoc’s earnings releases / SEC filings. (Key Q3 2025 earnings release PDF: `https://s21.q4cdn.com/672268105/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/TDOC-2025-09-30-EPR-FINAL.pdf`)
- **Terminology caution**:
  - **GAAP** is what the financial statements report.
  - Anything that “removes amortization” or “removes SBC” is **non‑GAAP** (a useful lens, but not GAAP profit).
  - **Amortization is non-cash**, but it reflects **real past cash spend** (acquisitions and/or capitalized software). The amortization expense itself doesn’t use cash in the current period.

**Note on “Amort” in this table:** where a specific value is shown, **“Amort” refers to the GAAP line item “amortization of intangible assets” (total)**. Teladoc sometimes also calls out **“amortization of acquired intangibles”** separately in the narrative; that acquired-only number will be lower than the GAAP total.

## 3. THE THREE PROFIT KILLERS — 

### A. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT — The Livongo Hangover

| Year  | Goodwill Impairment | Remaining Goodwill |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2022  | $13,402.8M         | ~$1,073M           |
| 2023  | $0                 | $1,073M            |
| 2024  | $790M (BetterHelp) | **$283M**          |
| 2025  | $71.8M (Catapult/Telecare) | **$283M**   |

**VERDICT: Nearly fully written down. Only ~$283M of goodwill remains (as of Sept 30, 2025).**
Integrated Care goodwill = $0 (fully written off in 2022 impairments).
BetterHelp started 2024 at $1,073M → $790M impairment → $283M remaining.
The 2020 Livongo acquisition ($18.5B) destroyed ~$15B+ in shareholder value through impairments.
2025 impairments ($71.8M) were new goodwill from Catapult/Telecare acquisitions immediately
written down (IC fair value < carrying value at acquisition), net balance unchanged at $283M.

### B. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES — The Silent Killer

**What this line item is (and isn’t):**
- **Amortization expense is non-cash in the current period.**
- But it generally reflects **prior cash spend** (M&A purchase price allocated to intangible assets and/or capitalized software that was paid for earlier).
- The exact split between “acquired intangibles” vs “capitalized software amortization” depends on Teladoc’s accounting classification; treat any split below as an **estimate** unless tied to a specific filing footnote.

| Period | Total Amort. | Acquired Intangibles Only | Cap. Software | Intangible Assets (Net) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| FY2023 | $325.9M     | ~$208M                   | ~$118M        | $1,677.8M              |
| FY2024 | $363.4M     | $230.3M                  | $133.1M       | $1,431.4M              |
| 9M2025 | $258.7M     | ~$163M                   | ~$96M         | $1,336.7M              |
| FY2025E| ~$345M      | ~$215M                   | ~$130M        | ~$1,250M (est.)        |

Per share impact (total amort): FY2024 = -$2.13/share, FY2025E = ~-$1.96/share

**VERDICT: This is the #1 ongoing accounting drag on GAAP EPS (outside of one-time impairments).**
- Total amortization running at ~$345M/year (~$86M/quarter)
- Acquired intangibles (~$215M/yr): declining as M&A assets fully amortize — this part goes away
- Capitalized software (~$130M/yr): ongoing cost of doing business — this part persists
- Net acquired intangible balance declining → acquisition-related amort drops ~$20-30M/year
- **The amortization expense itself is non-cash**; cash impact is via **earlier** M&A cash paid and/or **ongoing capex/capitalized software** (see cash flow).

### C. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION — Improving Rapidly

| Period | SBC Expense | Per Share Impact | Trend    |
|--------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| FY2023 | $201.6M    | -$1.22/share    |          |
| FY2024 | $146.0M    | -$0.86/share    | ↓ 28%    |
| 9M2025 | $64.5M     | -$0.37/share    |          |
| FY2025E| ~$86M      | ~-$0.49/share   | ↓ 41%    |

**VERDICT: Already fixing itself.** Down from $201M → estimated $86M in just 2 years.
Reflects lower stock price = fewer option grants needed, plus post-restructuring smaller headcount.

## 4. BRIDGE TO POSITIVE EPS — What Needs to Change?

### Current State (FY2025 Guidance Midpoint)
```
Expected Net Loss:                     -$207M    (-$1.18/share)
Shares Outstanding:                     ~176M

NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN THAT LOSS:
  + Amortization of Intangibles         +$345M    (+$1.96/share)
  + Stock-Based Compensation             +$86M    (+$0.49/share)
  + Goodwill Impairments                 +$72M    (+$0.41/share)
  + Depreciation                         +$14M    (+$0.08/share)
  + Restructuring                        +$16M    (+$0.09/share)
                                        ──────
  = NON-GAAP NET INCOME PROXY           +$326M    (+$1.85/share) ✅ POSITIVE (but not a company-reported metric)
```

### THE MATH: Removing Amortization (Non‑GAAP “Pre‑Amort” View)
```
GAAP Net Loss (FY2025E):               -$207M    (-$1.18/share)
+ Amortization of Intangibles:         +$345M    (+$1.96/share)
                                        ──────
= CASH EARNINGS (ex-amort only):       +$138M    (+$0.78/share) ✅ POSITIVE
```

**The single biggest lever is amortization of intangibles ($345M/yr).
Without that ONE item, TDOC would already be profitable on a “pre‑amortization” (non‑GAAP) basis.**

---

## 5. REALISTIC TIMELINE TO GAAP-POSITIVE EPS

### Scenario Analysis: When Does GAAP EPS Turn Positive?

**Current Annual Drags (FY2025):**
- Amortization: ~$345M (declining ~$20-30M/year naturally)
- SBC: ~$86M (declining ~$30M/year)
- Goodwill: ~$72M (should be near zero going forward, only $283M left)
- Restructuring: ~$16M (one-time, should end)

**Assumption: Adjusted EBITDA stays ~$280M (conservative)**

| Year   | Amort (est.) | SBC (est.) | Goodwill | Restructuring | Net Adjustment | Adj. EBITDA | EBITDA less add-backs (rough) |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 2025   | $345M       | $86M      | $72M     | $16M          | $519M          | $280M       | No (-$239M)          |
| 2026E  | $310M       | $65M      | $0       | $5M           | $380M          | $290M       | No (-$90M)           |
| 2027E  | $260M       | $55M      | $0       | $0            | $315M          | $300M       | **CLOSE (-$15M)**    |
| 2028E  | $200M       | $50M      | $0       | $0            | $250M          | $310M       | **YES (+$60M)**      |

Note: This is a **rough** bridge using a subset of add-backs. True GAAP net income also depends on interest, taxes, other income/expense, depreciation, and acquisition/integration items.

**Best case: GAAP breakeven by late 2027**
**Base case: GAAP profitable in 2028**
**If BetterHelp recovers faster or intangibles amortize faster: could accelerate to 2026-2027**

## 6. WHAT CAN MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY CHANGE?

### Lever 1: FIX BETTERHELP (Highest Impact)
```
BetterHelp Adjusted EBITDA Trend:
  2023: $136.2M (12.0% margin)
  2024:  $77.8M ( 7.5% margin)  ↓↓
  2025E: ~$31M  (~2.7% margin)  ↓↓↓ BLEEDING

BetterHelp Revenue Trend:
  2023: $1,133.6M
  2024: $1,040.7M  (-8.2%)
  2025E:  ~$953M   (-8.5%)
```
- BetterHelp spends enormous amounts on advertising (majority of the $706M/yr ad budget)
- Paying users declining: 457K (2023) → 405K (2024) → 389K (2025)
- Insurance acceptance rollout could stabilize users and reduce CAC
- **IF BetterHelp margins return to 12%: adds ~$85M to bottom line = +$0.48/share**

### Lever 2: CONTINUE SBC REDUCTION (Already Happening)
```
SBC Trajectory:
  2023: $201.6M
  2024: $146.0M  (-28%)
  2025E: ~$86M   (-41%)
  2026E: ~$65M   (target)  → saves another $21M = +$0.12/share
```

### Lever 3: GROW INTEGRATED CARE (Margin Expansion)
```
Integrated Care EBITDA Margin:
  2023: 13.1%
  2024: 15.2%  ↑
  2025: ~15.2% (steady)
  Target: 18-20% → could add $45-75M = +$0.25-$0.43/share
```
- Members growing (~93.9M in Q3'24 → 102.5M in Q3'25) but ARPU declining (~$1.36 → $1.27)
- Need to cross-sell more services per member and raise ARPU

### Lever 4: CUT ADVERTISING SPEND (Risky but Powerful)
```
Ad & Marketing Spend:
  2023: $688.9M (26.5% of revenue)
  2024: $705.8M (27.5% of revenue)  ← INCREASED despite lower revenue
  9M2025: $503.7M (26.7%)

If cut to 22% of revenue (~$560M): saves ~$146M = +$0.83/share
```
- Most of this is BetterHelp direct-to-consumer marketing
- Cutting too aggressively accelerates BetterHelp revenue decline
- Insurance acceptance at BetterHelp could naturally reduce needed ad spend over time

### Lever 5: REDUCE G&A OVERHEAD
```
G&A Trend (including SBC portion):
  2023: $464.7M (17.9% of revenue)
  2024: $435.5M (16.9% of revenue)
  9M2025: $323.5M (17.1% annualized)
  
G&A ex-SBC:
  2024: $435.5M - $68.9M SBC = $366.6M
  Target 14% of revenue: ~$357M → saves ~$10M
```

## 7. BALANCE SHEET SNAPSHOT (as of Sept 30, 2025)

```
ASSETS                              LIABILITIES
Cash:           $726.2M             Convertible Notes (non-current): $994.0M (due 2027)
Accounts Rec:   $210.8M             Accounts Payable:                 $52.2M
Intangibles:  $1,336.7M             Accrued Expenses (curr):         $205.9M
Goodwill:       $283.2M             Accrued Comp (curr):              $76.8M
Other assets:   $321.6M             Deferred Rev (curr):              $70.1M
                                    Op Lease Liab (LT):               $37.8M
                                    Deferred Rev (LT):                $11.2M
                                    Deferred Tax (net):               $34.1M
                                    Other Liabilities:                 $4.2M
────────────                        ────────────────────────────
Total Assets: $2,878.5M             Total Liabilities:              $1,486.4M
                                    Equity:                         $1,392.1M

Notes-to-Equity (convertibles / equity): ~$994.0M / ~$1,392.1M = ~0.71x
Total Liabilities-to-Equity: ~$1,486.4M / ~$1,392.1M = ~1.07x
Net Debt: $994M notes - $726M cash = $268M net debt (~0.19x net debt-to-equity)
```

**Key concern:** $994M convertible notes due 2027. They'll need to refinance or repay.
They already repaid ~$551M of convertible notes in Q2 2025, reducing cash from ~$1.3B to ~$726M.

## 8. SUMMARY — THE BULL CASE FOR POSITIVE EPS

### What's ACTUALLY preventing positive GAAP EPS today:

| Item | Annual Impact | Cash Impact? | Will It Go Away? |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Amortization (total)** | **-$345M (-$1.96/sh)** | **NO** | **Acquired portion (~$215M) declining; cap software (~$130M) ongoing** |
| Stock-Based Comp | -$86M (-$0.49/sh) | No (dilution) | Declining rapidly |
| Goodwill Impairments | -$72M (-$0.41/sh) | No | Nearly done ($283M left) |
| Restructuring | -$16M (-$0.09/sh) | Yes | Likely ending |
| BetterHelp Margin Erosion | -$100M+ vs 2023 | Yes | Uncertain |

### The most important thing to understand:

1. **TDOC is already cash-flow positive**: $170-185M free cash flow guided for 2025
2. **TDOC is already "adjusted" profitable**: ~$280M adjusted EBITDA in 2025
3. **The GAAP loss is 80%+ driven by non-cash amortization (both acquired intangibles and internal software)**
4. **Amortization is the biggest recurring GAAP drag** (a “pre-amortization” view turns earnings positive, but that is non‑GAAP)
5. **This amortization is DECLINING every year and will largely phase out by 2028-2029**

### What could accelerate the path:
- BetterHelp stabilization + insurance acceptance → margin recovery
- Further SBC reduction (already on track)
- Integrated Care ARPU improvement / cross-selling
- Modest revenue growth (even 2-3% helps)
- No more goodwill impairments (likely, given small remaining balance)

### What could delay it:
- BetterHelp continues declining (biggest risk)
- More acquisitions creating new goodwill/intangible balances
- Convertible debt refinancing at higher rates
- Competitive pressure on Integrated Care ARPU

## 9. CHEAT SHEET — TDOC AT A GLANCE

```
CASH:           $726M   (was $1.3B → paid off $551M convertible notes in Q2 2025)
DEBT:           $994M   (convertible notes due 2027, need to refinance)
NET DEBT:       $268M   ($994M - $726M)
FREE CASH FLOW: ~$175M/yr  (the business DOES generate cash)

GOODWILL:       $283M   (company total as of Sept 30, 2025; segment allocation not shown here)
                        Was $14.5B post-Livongo → $13B+ written off
                        Almost done. Low risk of further impairment.

AMORTIZATION:   ~$345M/yr total (~$86M/qtr) — primary recurring GAAP EPS drag
                → Acquired intangibles: ~$215M/yr (declining, goes away)
                → Capitalized software:  ~$130M/yr (ongoing, stays)
                $1,337M intangibles remaining. Purely non-cash.

SBC:            ~$86M/yr and falling fast
                $201M (2023) → $146M (2024) → ~$86M (2025) → ~$65M (2026E)

VALUATION:      (time-sensitive — as of **Feb 6, 2026**, per current quote)
                TDOC price ~$5.02; shares ~177.349M → market cap ~**$0.89B**
                FY2024 revenue $2.5696B → P/S ~**0.35x**

ADJUSTED EBITDA: ~$280M/yr — ALREADY PROFITABLE on operating basis
GAAP EPS:        ~-$1.18/yr — primarily driven by amortization (and also SBC / other items)
```

## 10. OPERATIONAL KPIs ("The Engine Check")

Are they actually losing customers? The story is mixed.

| Metric | Q3 2024 | Q3 2025 | Trend | Analysis |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| **U.S. Integrated Care Members** | 93.9M | **102.5M** | **+9%** | **GROWING.** The core B2B business is healthy and winning clients. |
| **BetterHelp Paying Users** | 398k | **382k** | **-4%** | **CHURNING.** High ad spend is no longer driving growth. |
| **Integrated Care ARPU** | $1.36 | **$1.27** | **-7%** | **WEAKENING.** Adding lower-value members (e.g., chronic care only vs full suite). |

**Takeaway:** The "platform" is growing (more members), but monetization per member is slipping. BetterHelp is shrinking despite massive marketing spend.

## 11. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (TDOC vs. HIMS)

The Tale of Two Telehealths: Value vs. Growth.

| Feature | Teladoc (TDOC) | Hims & Hers (HIMS) | The Winner? |

| **Valuation (P/S)** | **~0.35x** (as of Feb 6, 2026) | **~5.4–5.5x** (as of Feb 6, 2026; uses FY2025 rev guide) | TDOC (Value Play) |
| **Profitability** | Adj. EBITDA Positive | GAAP Profitable | HIMS |
| **Market Sentiment** | "Distressed Asset" | "Growth Darling" | HIMS |

## 12. THE HIDDEN GEM: International Growth

While the U.S. narrative is negative, the international business is quietly outperforming.

*   **U.S. Revenue (Q3 25):** $509.8M (**-5% YoY**)
*   **Int'l Revenue (Q3 25):** $116.7M (**+12% YoY**)

**Why this matters:** International markets are less saturated than the U.S. and represent a long-term growth engine that is currently masked by the U.S. decline. If U.S. revenue just flattens (0% growth), International could pull the total company back into growth territory.
